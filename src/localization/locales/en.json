Little daily improvements confidently enhance life, and the free mind is constantly looking how to fill now emptied todo list so that it could feel the pleasure of completing tasks again and again ‚Äî and it is a direct route towards improving everything surrounding me.\n\nAll in all, Todorant, no matter how simple at first glance, can become a faithful ally in any business. Thank you, Nikita, for unleashing the aspects of true productivity and sharing them with us in a convenient solution.\n\nThankful Todorant subscriber."

All of them are overcomplicated.\n4. Telegram bot."

This idea with one task and concentration on it struck me, it seems obvious, but I couldn\"t use it before.\n\nI usually tracked tasks and ideas in Notes, which should be done soon, but I did not approach it as a system. I have been using the service for a couple of weeks, not very actively, but I think this is a very strong way to systemize the affairs and tasks.\n\nThank you for your work!"

Strange as it may seem, it doesn't force you to think rationally.\n\nI'm irrational by nature, I can't just lead 1 project (I burn out quickly). My life is multitasking! 3 projects in parallel are easy, but 3 is not enough... 7 sounds more like it. And your service allows you to achieve this. It is the alternation of tasks that prevents the brain from burning out in one particular direction. And somehow, magically, it alternates tasks from one project to another."

Yes, thousand times yes.\n\nI like Todorant, it lets me free up my 'operating memory' and allows me to think about solving problems, not about remembering them. As Nikita (the creator) correctly wrote ‚Äî with constant and correct use, tasks that used to cast true biblical fear will stop appearing. And this will not happen because the complex tasks will stop coming. It will become clear to you (and to me, and everyone) that 'the road will be overpowered by those walking', 'the way to the thousand miles begins with one step'."

That's the whole point of the app ‚Äî it helped me to concentrate without constantly shuffling my todos.\n\nOf course, you can set tasks and forget about them, but for me, it's easier to go back to a minimalistic application with one task, rather than to spend half a day looking for what task to work on now out of a hundred planned in Telegram or Notion.\n\nI was especially pleased with the update with hashtags ‚Äî now all stats are on the palm of my hand, I can track and share with friends how many tasks I have completed this month.\n\nThank you a lot for Todorant!"
